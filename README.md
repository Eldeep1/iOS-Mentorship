# iOS-Mentorship
based on my programming experience, I believe that to learn almost any framework at the biginner level, you should always get to know about:
1. the programming language
2. the framework syntax and basic building elements
3. sense of the commonly used architectures and design patterns
4. building nicely look UI
5. element/widget/whatever life cycle from init to dispose
6. studying the Operating system that the program runs on
7. haven't reached that far before 

so I will try to structure the folders to have useful notes and tips for all of that steps, in case I have managed to survive all of that 

wish me luck :)
